# BUGOUT
Multiplayer web implementation of Go/Baduk/Weiqi using Kafka as the backend üêõ 

- simple lobby... Join game and put you with the first player who is waiting
- react JS for UI. KISS
- Kafka is an audit log of all moves.
- maybe pushpin to enable SSE /push to web client and hide Kafka layer from internet
-  write rust Middleware to adjudicate... Command (move black 5 16) vs event
- on game over, replay game moves quickly
- on join game, race to pick a color
- allow handicap
